A unified repository of coursework fragments from [UC Berkeley MIDS Program](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mids) 2022-2024. This is a collection of my adapted assignment submissions, classwork notebooks, and other relevant materials. It serves to showcase the scope of work, and also for personal reference.
